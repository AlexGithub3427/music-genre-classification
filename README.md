# music-genre-classification
There has been a growth in music production in the following years which has led to massive collections of audio content that require specific organization and categorization. Music genre classification will allow applications such as music recommendation, new sets of playlists, and different forms of content discovery. Labeling music manually will be very time consuming and different genres change for each listener using digital streaming services for music. We plan to develop a machine learning model that takes different music tracks and puts them into different genres based on the audio features. We will develop the model to take in different rhythm and frequencies based on the music track being tested. We will expand different machine learning algorithms to develop a music genre classification and evaluate the performance of our model.
